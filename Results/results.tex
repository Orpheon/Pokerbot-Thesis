\section{Performance Metrics}

\subsection{Winnings}
- result overview, what is the output
- reproducibility
- observed weird behaviors
- sorted by?
- correlation internal vs overall
- how to rank?
 - average
 - mean
 - pctl
- what sorting makes sense?
 - squared errors
- sorting vs n upsets
- exploiters -> ? where expected winner lost with highest negative


\subsection{TrueSkill}
- results overview, what is the output
- does it converge?
- reproducibility
- does matchup matter?
- weird behavior
- internal vs overall correlation

\section{Agents}

\subsection{Baselines}

-how do the various architectures do in training
    -convergence speed
    -skill cap
    -dependence on features
    -consistency

\subsection{Q-Learning}

\subsection{Soft Actor-Critic}


\section{Populations}
-how do the various population do in training
    -convergence speed
    -skill cap
    -dependence on features
    -consistency

\subsection{Divergence of Identical Populations}
-how convergent are league setups?
    -do different leagues "drift apart" or cover mostly the same strats

\subsection{Exploiters}
-how much can you overfit against particular types of agents?
    -baselines
    -other league
    -particular aggression/tightness quadrant

\subsection{Optimal Populations}
