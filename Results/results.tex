\section{Training}
\subsection{Metrics}

    -TrueSkill sucks if you compare wildly different skill levels
-20pcl ~ TrueSkill
-total winnings
\subsection{Architectures}
-how do the various architectures do in training
    -convergence speed
    -skill cap
    -dependence on features
    -consistency
\section{Strategies}
-strategy distribution
\subsection{Consistency}
-how convergent are league setups?
    -do different leagues "drift apart" or cover mostly the same strats
\subsection{Exploiters}
-how much can you overfit against particular types of agents?
    -baselines
    -other league
    -particular aggression/tightness quadrant
