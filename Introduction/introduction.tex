\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Poker Competition}
-Competitive game that rewards both risk assessment and opponent modeling
-Simple and fast to compute
-6 player holdem does not satisfy Nash requirement {CITE PAPER explaining why this matters, I think it was the Pluribus paper?}

\section{Possible Approaches}
-Lookup tables {Find citation, if possible?}
-MDP {again, citation? The RL introduction book could be cited, if nothing else, but application to poker would be nice}
-DeepRL with counterfactual regret
    -Libratus: 1v1 (\cite{Libratus})
    -Pluribus: Same team, holdem (\cite{Pluribus})

\section{Our Choice}
-AlphaStar (\cite{AlphaStar})
-{Find citation on metas of competitive esports of different continents being very different}
-Population-based learning, A-Life citation maybe?
